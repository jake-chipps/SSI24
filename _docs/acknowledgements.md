## Tribal Land

We acknowledge that Montana State University and the K-12 schools across Montana are on the ancestral lands of American Indians, including the A’aninin (Gros Ventre), Amskapi/Piikani (Blackfeet), Annishinabe (Chippewa/Ojibway), Annishinabe/Métis (Little Shell Chippewa), Apsáalooke (Crow), Ktunaxa/Ksanka (Kootenai), Lakota, Dakota (Sioux), Nakoda (Assiniboine), Ne-i-yah-wahk (Plains Cree), Qíispé (Pend d’Oreille), Seliš (Salish), and Tsétsêhéstâhese/So’taahe (Northern Cheyenne). Through our work to improve student learning, we honor and respect these twelve tribal nations that call Montana home today, by drawing inspiration from ways of knowing within these communities.
