### Museum of the Rockies

![Museum of the Rockies](../images/mor.jpeg)

Museum of the Rockies (MOR) is a college-level division of Montana State University, a Smithsonian Affiliate, a repository for federal fossils, and an independent 501(c)3 nonprofit institution. It is recognized as one of the world's finest research and history museums and is renowned for displaying an extensive collection of dinosaur fossils, including a full-scale T. rex skeleton! The museum’s exhibits, collections, programs, and research create a community resource that brings the world to Montana and shares the Northern Rockies with the world. Museum of the Rockies is dedicated to engaging all learners, from babies to adults who are young at heart, in explorations of science, history, and art through an array of educational programs. From our founding in 1957, we have shared the museum’s collections with the public, engaging visitors through special events, programs, and outreach materials. Thanks to the Opening Doors for Montana Schoolchildren fund, we are able to offer free admission for all Montana schools. As a community resource and regional museum, MOR’s education team encourages curiosity for people of all ages.
