## We are the Explorers! Bringing Together NASAs STEM Graphic Novels, Robotics and Moon Exploration

Participants will have the chance to blend language arts, programming, and exploration. The NASA First Woman graphic novel series follows the fictional adventures of Callie Rodriquez and her colleagues and the challenges of exploring the Moon. We will explore robotics and programming in a hands-on learning experience from the First Woman Camp Guides. Discover ways to adjust the lesson to student needs and your teaching setting from camps to classrooms.
