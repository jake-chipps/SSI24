## Integrating Indigenous Wisdom into K-12 Science Education

This presentation offers a transformative approach to K-12 science education, centered around the principles of Relationship, Respect, Relevance, Reciprocity, and Responsibility (5 R's). Grounded in Indigenous wisdom and aligned with Montana science content standards, this framework offers a culturally responsive way to engage both Indigenous and non-Native students. By emphasizing the interconnectedness of all scientific concepts through relational thinking, we aim to foster deeper understanding and appreciation for science while honoring diverse perspectives. Join us in reimagining science education through the lens of cultural inclusivity and holistic learning.
