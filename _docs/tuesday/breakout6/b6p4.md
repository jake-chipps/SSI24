title: Exploring Lightâ€™s Invisible Property - Using Low-Cost Demonstrations to Understand Polarization in Nature and Technology
permalink: /docs/b6p4/
---

We will present demonstration ideas for exploring polarized light in the real world, which use sheet polarizers that we provide and other inexpensive materials. These demonstrations can be adapted for many grades: younger students can learn to identify polarized light in the sky, reflections from windows, or on computer screens, while older students can learn about the phenomena that create polarized light and calculate the brightness of polarized light based on vector math.
